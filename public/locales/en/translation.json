If we do not have all addresses in Bavaria stored, you can use the coordinates instead. You can find the coordinates, for example, in Google Maps. Press Enter to confirm the input and start the simulation.",

    "p-3": "The website automatically downloads the 3D building data for the specified location and then initiates the simulation. Depending on the performance of your device and the size of the building data, this process may take a few seconds. Please be patient. If it takes too long, you can reduce the number of simulations or the building radius on the left side.",
    "h3-4": "Visualize the simulation results",
    "p-4": "After completing the solar potential calculation, the roof and facade of the building will be colored. Yellow indicates a very high potential for a solar system, while blue indicates a lower potential. In the displayed 3D view, you can navigate using the left and right mouse buttons, as well as your mouse wheel.",
    "h3-5": "More details",
    "p-5": "Once the 3D building data has been downloaded, the website begins the calculation of the solar potential. This is achieved through ray tracing to determine the angle of sunlight incidence on the roof and facade. The data used in this project is sourced from the OpenData Portal of the Bavarian Surveying Authority and is available under the CC BY 4.0 license: https://geodaten.bayern.de/opengeodata/OpenDataDetail.html?pn=lod2. The LOD2 data from March 2023 was used for this purpose. We express our gratitude to the source for providing these data, which have contributed to the realization of this project."

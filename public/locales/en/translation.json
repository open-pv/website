    "introduction": "Solar systems make a significant contribution to the energy transition. Germany aims to triple the installed PV capacity by 2030. Roof and balcony systems play an essential role in this, as they enable decentralized energy supply without causing additional land consumption. Balcony power plants, in particular, allow tenants without their own property to generate a considerable part of their electricity themselves. However, many potential users lack the background knowledge to assess the suitability of their building for photovoltaics. This is where we want to help with OpenPV, to enable a simple analysis of the PV potential on one's own building. The goal of OpenPV is to simulate and display the solar potential of buildings across Germany with just a few clicks, based on an address.",
    "generalDescription": {
      "h": "How does openpv.de work?",
      "p": "On the homepage, you can select your building either via the search field or the map. With a click on 'Start', the buildings of the selected location are loaded and the shading simulation is executed in your browser. After successful completion of the simulation, the PV potential of your building is displayed - yellow stands for good potential, dark blue for poor potential with a lot of shading. Afterwards, you can draw a PV system or adjust the simulation options."

    "data": {
      "h": "What data do we use?",
      "p1": "We use various open datasets for the PV simulation. These are the 3D building data (LOD2 data) from various state surveying offices, the annual irradiation data for Germany of direct and diffuse radiation from the DWD (German Weather Service),",
      "p2": "the terrain model from sonny,",

      "h": "Why is OpenPV Open Source?",
      "p": "Public Money, Public Code! The creation of our website was made possible through public funds, which is why the code is publicly available. Open source code also increases trust in the website and the simulation results. Additionally, other people can modify and reuse the code."

    "steps": {
      "introduction": "Instructions for using openpv.de:",
      "1": "On the OpenPV homepage, the first step is to select a building for the simulation. This can be done either by entering and searching for an address or by zooming and selecting on the map. Left-clicking on the building displays a menu through which the simulation can be started.",
      "2": "Once the simulation is started, all relevant data for the selected building is loaded into the browser. This includes the 3D building data of the chosen building and the buildings in the neighborhood, the terrain model, and vegetation data (if available). For the yield calculation, two shading simulations are then performed, one with direct and one with diffuse radiation. For direct radiation, an average is taken over 100 randomly selected sun positions throughout the year. This number can be adjusted in the options. Based on the building's coordinates, climate data for the location from the German Weather Service (DWD) is used to account for local climate influences. For shading, the selected building and the buildings in the immediate vicinity are used. Shading by hills and mountains is taken into account using a terrain model with a resolution of 30m. Shading by trees can only be included in federal states that provide open access to vegetation data (laser point clouds). This is the case in Bavaria, for example. If vegetation is displayed on the website, it is also considered for the shading simulation. When the simulation is complete, the result is displayed in the browser. The chosen building is colored according to the calculated solar potential. For better orientation, the terrain, a map, the neighboring buildings, and the existing vegetation are also displayed.",
      "3": "In the next step, a solar system can be drawn on the roof or façade using the 'Draw new PV system' button. By drawing the corner points, one or more solar systems of any shape can be created. Based on the previous simulation, an estimated annual electricity yield is then given for the drawn system.",
      "4": "In the last step, an economic feasibility calculation can be performed for the drawn systems. A standard load profile is scaled with the annual consumption, and a standard generation profile is scaled with the power of the solar system. Then, for a one-year time series with hourly resolution, consumption is compared with electricity generation. If a storage system is present, it can be used to store excess electricity or to provide electricity. The portion of electricity that no longer needs to be drawn from the grid thanks to the solar system is then multiplied by the electricity price. This results in the annual savings."
